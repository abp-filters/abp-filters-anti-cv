# ABP anti-circumvention filter list

Adblock Plus (ABP) filter list to fight "circumvention ads".

## Introduction

Some providers have begun to show ads that are harder to detect for ad-blocking tools like ABP, thus tricking ad-blocker users into downloading and displaying unrequested and intrusive advertising ("circumvention ads").

This filter list is drafted and maintained by ABP and is intended to detect and block circumvention ads including, in some cases, their tracking. Due to their fast pace nature, filters may be exploratory or ephemeral in nature.

The ABP anti-circumvention filter list is a supplementary list; it's not related or operated by the EasyList community and it doesn't replace EasyList filters or any other language-specific list.

## Installation

[**ABP Anti-Circumvention Filter List**](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/abp-filters-anti-cv.txt) is enabled by default in [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) version 3.1 or higher.
